# slack-log

Is a simple PHP class that posts to an `incoming-webhook` URL in a Slack channel. Although it uses the [PSR-3 Logger Interface](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-3-logger-interface.md) as a template it is not an actual dependency for it to work.

## Slack incoming webhook configuration

Follow this extensive article to guide you through, https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/using-slack-monitor-app/.

## Setup

Just include it in your project and edit the following two variables to your desired values.

```php
/**
 * The incoming-webhook URL the Slack
 * integration configuration provides.
 * @var [type]
 */
private $incomingWebhookURL = "";

/**
 * The username that will be used when
 * posting on the channel.
 * @var string
 */
private $username = "";
```

## Usage

```php
$slack = new SlackLogger("#general");
$slack->emergency("This is a slack `emergency` notification");
$slack->alert("This is a slack `alert` notification");
$slack->critical("This is a slack `critical` notification");
$slack->error("This is a slack `error` notification");
$slack->warning("This is a slack `warning` notification");
$slack->notice("This is a slack `notice` notification");
$slack->info("This is a slack `info` notification");
$slack->debug("This is a slack `debug` notification");
```
